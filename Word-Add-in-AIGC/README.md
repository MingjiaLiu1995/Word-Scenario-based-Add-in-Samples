## Build, run and debug the sample code 
### Manually run on your local machine
If you prefer to run the sample with clear and step-by-step instructions, follow the detailed steps provided below.
1. Install a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
4. *Optional*: If you're interested in exploring AIGC, with prerequisites all satisfied, you can fill in the parameters apiKey, endpoint and deployment in src/taskpane/components/utility/AIData.tsx to persist the Azure OpenAI account or you can skip this step to fill in the account when you operate the AI related UI.
5. If you cannot get an OpenAI account, just try the predefined functionality. Just go ahead.
6. cd src folder and execute following commands:
    ```console
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
7. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
